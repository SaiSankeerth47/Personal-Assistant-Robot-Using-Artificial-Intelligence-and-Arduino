# Personal-Assistant-Robot-Using-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Arduino
This project involves creating a Personal Assistant Robot that seamlessly combines AI and IoT. It tracks faces, avoids obstacles, and improves human-robot interaction. The robot uses ultrasonic sensors for real-time obstacle avoidance, ensuring safe navigation in dynamic environments. Its applications range from home automation to assisting individuals with limited mobility.

Employed CNN technology, Arduino, ultrasonic sensors, and a 2-megapixel camera with the Kendryte K210 processor.

3D-printed the car chassis to make the device lighter, and optimized the voltage to make the whole device work with 7.5 volts battery. The device can work for 45 minutes in a stretch. 

Integrated facial recognition for enhanced human-robot interaction. Created a sophisticated system for real-time obstacle detection and avoidance.

Positioned the system for versatile applications, including home automation and assistance for individuals with limited mobility.
